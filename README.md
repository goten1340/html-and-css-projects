# html-and-css-projects
For my html and css for the tech academy course

Project: Learned how to use link to a stylesheet. How to use relative and absolute paths to link images. Creating a box of text to give a brief desctription of what image the mouse is hovering. I also created a space station website, used emphasize tags to emphasize text

Cinema: Use the documentation of the bootstrap website to research what each bootstrap code does, and it was used to create a navbar. also used href to add the ability to click on a link to navigate to certain parts of the webpage.
